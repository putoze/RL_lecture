# 2023 NCHU RL Lecture

## Install the following Python libraries:
- python version 3.9.16
- PyYAML (yaml parser)
- NumPy (high-performance matrix library)
- PyTorch, aka “torch” (tensor & neural network library)
- OpenAI Gym version 0.25.2, aka “gym” (RL environment simulation library)
- Pygame & imageio-ffmpeg (for OpenAI video rendering)
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Matplotlib (data visualization)

## HW Note

- Hw1: Rabbit farm <br>
To make you be familiar with python and its libraries.

- Hw2: Value Function using matrix approach <br>
Numpy is a good tools for solving matrix computing problems.

- Hw3: Value Function & optimal policy using iterative DP method <br>
Getting to know more about RL with "Values" & "Policy".

- Hw4: Monte Carlo with Cat-Mouse environment <br>
Testing environments with Cat-Mouse envs with our First real RL method "Monte Carlo".

- Hw5: Q-Learning with Cat-Mouse env <br>
A "model free" method, computing "Q(S,A)" without building the States as last homework.

- Hw6: Sarsa & Expected Sarsa with epsilon greedy policy <br>
Sarsa is a little bit more conservative strategy with more exploring state while implementing "Epsilon Decay".

- Hw7: Pytorch & CNN <br>
An overview with CNN models & pytorch API.

- Hw8: Semi-gradient TD(0) with NN function approximation <br>
Cat-Mouse env again! Learning our "Values" & "Policy" with NN model. Interesting.

- Hw9: Q-Learning with NN && Acrobot environment <br>
Off-policy Q-Learning sometimes causes "Dead Triad". How do we solve it?

- Hw10: Using Policy-gradient with Monte Carlo to implement the missing code in pg_mc.py
