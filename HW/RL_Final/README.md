## docker notes

1. What docker is? <br>
- Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications <br>
- package any machine into docker and run on any machines <br>
- Can easily remove the application and all its dependencies in one go <br>

2. virtual machine v.s container
- using a hypervisor to use different software in hardware (because they are different isolated environments)
- Each VM needs a full-blown OS
- Slow to start
- Resource intensive

3. Architecture of docker

4. installing docker

5. Development Workflow
